##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I used the guide that was provided with the lab.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I didnt have to refactor, however there was some code that only seem to work in a particular file so I had to leave it in there
