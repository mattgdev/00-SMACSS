##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I used the guide provided to me.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I didnt have to do any refactoring, however I had to put some code in a file that I didnt think was necessarily correct for the sake of makeing the code work.
